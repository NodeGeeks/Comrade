Links and Credits

`https://github.com/myurasov/Salesforce-REST-API-Ionic-Framework-App-Sample/tree/master/www/js` - A lot of what i have done to build comrade is based on the fundementals and structure to this project i found. Lets just say it helped me with a few issues like figuring out how i could use the inAppBrowser to grab basically any oAuth2 provider. It also helped me understand routing a little better being new to AngularJS and all.
